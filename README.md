# Small-Projects
Small Visual Studio projects (some working, some not)
These are projects ive done over the years as a student to get more familiar with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Angular etc, alongside other random stuff I make when bored
Some of them work, some of them do not, some of them are old, some of them newer, just putting them here for safekeeping
